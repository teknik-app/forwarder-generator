# Bulk RetroArch Forwarder Generator

This generates forwarders for ROMs supported by NX RetroArch. Put ROMs in the `input` folder (create it if it doesn't exist) and clone https://github.com/teknik-app/forwarder-images into the `images` folder (also create it if it doesn't exist). Run `node main.js` - the forwarders will be in the `output` folder and the titledb will be in `titledb.json`, next to the script.
